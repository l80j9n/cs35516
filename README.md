Project   B   (Unit   between Grids 4-7 and Grids A-J),   First   FloorYou are required to compile the   take-off list, measurement sheet, query sheet and BOQ. (Hint: For   preliminaries, no need to prepare,    take-off list, measurement sheet and query sheet). Please use the   templates   provided   in   MyUni   (except   BOQ   as   it   will   be   prepared   using   CostX   or   other   estimating   software)   .   Please   note that you are   NOT   required to   price the   BOQ.   Pricing   is taught   in a different   course.
Recommended   procedure:
•          First, you   need   to   identify   the   items   that   should   be   measured   for   different   trades   using   the   take-off   list sheet, while   referrin代 写CONMGNT 7049 – Measurement and Estimating Assessment 3A Outline

•          Next, take-off quantities for those   identified items using the measurement sheets, following   measurement   rules   in ANZSMM   and   referring to   project drawings and specifications.
•          Use query   sheet   to   mention   the   queries/assumptions   made   on   missing   details/   discrepancies.   In   the   query sheet,   both columns should   be filled. That   is the query   and your   assumed   answer.
•          BOQ for   Preliminaries   and   Other   Trades   –   For   Trades’   BOQ,   use   the   quantities   you   measured   in   the   measurement   sheets,   also   remember   to   add   appropriate   ‘preamble   notes’   and   ‘trade   preliminary   items’ before those measured items to make a complete   BOQ. Preamble   notes and trade   preliminary   items   are   listed   at   the   beginning   of   each   ANZSMM   section.   For   Preliminary   BOQ,   include   minimum   12   preliminaries that are applicable to the given   drawing.

•          If   you   are    required   to    measure   ground   floor,    please   measure   items    between   Finished   Floor   Level   (FFL) of Ground   Floor to   FFL of   First   Floor   (including floor   finishes   of ground floor   level   but   excluding   floor   finishes   of   first   floor).
•          If you   are   required   to   measure   first   floor,   please   measure   items   between   FFL   of   First   Floor   to   FFL   of   Roof   (including floor finishes of first floor   level   but excluding floor finishes   of   roof   level).
•          Concrete,   Formwork –   Exclude staircases,   lintels and   beams
